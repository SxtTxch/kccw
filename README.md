## creative ideas that make us different

### wspolpraca wielu instytucji w celu wzmocnienia sił w danej akcji
multiple organizations working together to amplify impact. when institutions collaborate, they can achieve more than working in isolation.

### 2 + 2 = 5
when two institutions join forces, they can accomplish more than two working separately. the synergy effect creates exponential impact.

### bounty system
sponsors can contribute funds to specific volunteer actions, creating financial incentives that motivate more volunteers to participate in high-impact projects.

### wspomnienia - memory pins
after successful volunteer actions, participants can add memory pins to the map with photos and comments, creating a living archive of positive change and community stories.

### bla bla car
no emojis in polish - keeping the interface clean and professional while maintaining cultural authenticity.
